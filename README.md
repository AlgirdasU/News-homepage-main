## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- BEM
- JS

### What I learned

My one of favorite headache on css is grid so I decided to go back and practise again. There is a side effect in certain situation that you can write responsive design without breakpoints by using just two lines of css e.g. 1) display: grid; 2) grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(35rem, 1fr));
